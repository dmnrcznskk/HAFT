# Team project developed within the scope of the PRO course

## Project Workflow Guidelines
* One branch corresponds to a single module.
* Pull requests are approved by the Project Manager and merged into the main branch.

## Repository Structure
The repository consists of two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

* **Frontend**
  * (details to be added here)
* **Backend**
  * Comprises two subdirectories: `API` and `algorithm`.
  * The **API** handles user authorization and provides necessary data for the frontend.
